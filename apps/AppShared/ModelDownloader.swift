// ModelDownloader.swift — in-app model delivery for the Core AI sample apps.
//
// Downloads `.aimodel` bundles (directory trees) from a Hugging Face model repo into a
// destination directory. Every file streams into a hidden staging directory and a bundle is
// renamed into place only when ALL of its files are complete: AIModel must never see a partial
// bundle — a partially-present bundle poisons the content-keyed coreai-cache (later loads fail
// ENOENT until the cache is wiped).
//
// The payload of these bundles is one huge `main.mlirb` (e.g. ~30 GB for the Mac models) plus a
// few tiny tokenizer files, so the delivery is built around RANGE-CHUNKED PARALLELISM with
// CROSS-LAUNCH RESUME:
//   • Parallel: every file >`chunkSize` is split into byte-range chunks pulled CONCURRENTLY (up to
//     `maxConnections`) — a single HF/CDN connection is bandwidth-capped, so 6 connections on the
//     one big file is several times faster than a one-stream-per-file loop (which gave the 30 GB
//     file zero parallelism). Each chunk is written straight into its final offset of the staging
//     file (a FileHandle seek+write), so there is no concatenation pass and disk use stays at 1×
//     (peak RAM = chunkSize × maxConnections).
//   • Resumable across launches: each file has a sidecar bitmap (one byte per chunk) under
//     `<dest>/.dl-progress/<local>/…`. A chunk marks its bit done only AFTER its data is written
//     and closed, so `bit==1 ⟹ bytes present`. A re-`fetch` of an interrupted bundle keeps the
//     staging tree, reads the bitmaps, and re-downloads only the missing chunks — so a quit/crash
//     (or the OS killing the app) costs at most the one in-flight chunk, never the whole 30 GB.
//   • Background-tolerant (iOS): the whole fetch holds a UIKit background-task assertion, so a
//     brief trip to the background (app switcher, screen lock) doesn't drop the transfer. A longer
//     suspension that gets the app killed is covered by the resume above on next launch.
//
// Usage:
//   let items = [ModelDownloader.Item(remote: "ios-gpu/foo.aimodel", local: "foo.aimodel")]
//   await downloader.fetch(repo: "https://huggingface.co/org/repo", items: items, into: docs)
//
// `remote` is a directory (or file) path inside the repo; `local` is the name created under the
// destination. Items already present at the destination are skipped (they were placed
// atomically, so presence == complete). Downloaded bundles are excluded from iCloud backup.
