# Core AI performance ceiling — what's actually tapped (honest)

## General principles (reusable, not just this project)
1. **Custom Metal kernels beat MPSGraph ONLY for big memory-bound matmuls** (FFN, the 262144-vocab head).
   - Per-op kernelization of small ops is **futile** (measured: attn q/k/v/o int8 kernels were *slower*; any
     single op-class ≤1.3 ms — MPSGraph already handles small ops well).
   - **Whole-layer fusion does NOT beat MPSGraph either — CLOSED by measure-first** (SDPA fold 3.6× SLOWER,
     glue fold within-noise). Don't re-attempt it. See [`custom-metal-kernels.md`](custom-metal-kernels.md).
   - The **MLX gap (~2×) is STRUCTURAL**, not closeable by more kernel polishing: it decomposes into kernel
     coverage/efficiency (~2×, only FFN+head are custom; attention stays MPSGraph) × quant (~1.5–2×, MLX
     4-bit vs our int8) × host/framework/OS-runtime tax (~1.3×). ~80% of MLX is the in-design ceiling; the
     last ~15–25% is real OS-runtime tax you don't control.
2. **AOT (`coreai-build`) helps FIRST-RUN latency + per-shape re-specialization — NOT steady-state decode
   tok/s.** Once a shape is specialized + cached, the compute is identical. The throughput fix for the
   re-specialization tax is **fixed-shape buckets** (pad → 1 compile → reuse; ~60–80× collapse per shape);
   AOT removes the *first*-compile-per-bucket cost and the device first-run wait. So AOT = UX/enablement.
   See [`aot-and-specialization.md`](aot-and-specialization.md).
3. **int8 is the practical exactness floor for these LLMs** (int4 — linear and k-means — flips the next-token
   argmax; gate/up MLP must be int8). So quantization won't buy a big extra bandwidth win past int8 without a
   quality hit. See [`compression-reference.md`](compression-reference.md).
4. **The ANE's differentiated value is ENERGY, not peak tok/s.** Its throughput target (~34 tok/s class for a
   small LLM, and only after stateful-KV + int4 head + AOT) is *below* the Mac GPU's ~55. Pick ANE for
   battery/always-on/thermals, GPU for peak speed. See [`compute-units-and-authoring.md`](compute-units-and-authoring.md).

## Project evidence (gemma4 E2B, macOS, M4 Max)
- host-cache fixed-shape GPU decode (8/8 exact) + **Lever A** (FFN fused-int8 kernel) + **Lever #3** (fused
  int8 GPU head+argmax) → **core ~14.2 ms / ~70.5 tok/s, Swift end-to-end ~55 tok/s**.
- **Lever B (whole-layer fusion) CLOSED** by measure-first (above). int8-MPSGraph FFN was a *regression* vs
  fp16-MPSGraph (the LUT-dequant traffic > byte savings for a matvec); the custom fused-int8 kernel wins by
  reading only uint8 indices + a tiny codebook.
- Efficiency: int8 core 2.0 GB / 15.7 ms ≈ 127 GB/s ≈ **23% of M4 Max peak (~546 GB/s)** ⇒
  **efficiency/dispatch-bound, not bandwidth-bound** (≈1000 Metal dispatches/token; MLX fuses the whole layer
  to ~0). That dispatch overhead is the structural gap, and layer-fusion (the only thing that would close it)
  doesn't beat MPSGraph here.

## Decision implication
- For **peak speed**, Core AI on the Mac GPU is **near its ceiling**; going materially faster means leaving
  Core AI (MLX / llama.cpp hand-tuned Metal) — which forfeits the ANE path and Foundation Models integration.
- So Core AI's real differentiation is **on-device privacy + ANE energy-efficiency + the Foundation Models /
  guided-generation integration**, *not* winning a GPU tok/s race. Optimize for the right axis.
- Practical: **ship the GPU path at current numbers**; treat ANE as an energy play (parked on the Apple
  KV-write fix); use AOT for first-run UX + (for gemma4-iOS) to potentially **un-chunk**, not for throughput.
