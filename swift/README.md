# Swift package — `ZooFMProvider` + `CoreAIRunner`

Two libraries in one package:

| Product | What | Status |
|---|---|---|
| [`ZooFMProvider`](Sources/ZooFMProvider/) | Zoo bundles behind FoundationModels' `LanguageModelSession`, with **tool calling**, streaming, usage events, and append-only KV reuse — the capabilities Apple's `CoreAILanguageModel` adapter doesn't implement | ✅ verified on macOS 27 beta (Qwen3.5-0.8B int8) |
| [`CoreAIRunner`](Sources/CoreAIRunner/) | Self-contained N-state engine on the low-level `CoreAI` system framework only (no `coreai-models` dependency) | ⚠️ DRAFT — authored on macOS 26.6, not yet compiled |

## ZooFMProvider

```swift
import FoundationModels
import ZooFMProvider

let model = try await ZooLanguageModel(resourcesAt: bundleDir)   // any zoo LanguageBundle
let session = LanguageModelSession(model: model, tools: [WeatherTool()])
let answer = try await session.respond(to: "What's the weather in Tokyo?")
```

The same `session.respond` / `streamResponse` / `Tool` / `@Generable` API as Apple's built-in
model. The model emits Qwen/Hermes-style `<tool_call>` JSON, the framework executes your Swift
`Tool`, and the model answers grounded on the result. `<think>` blocks stream to
`Transcript.reasoning` entries; `session.usage` reports prompt/generated token counts including
KV-cache reuse (`cachedTokenCount`).

**Requirements** — same as [`../apps/`](../apps/README.md): clone `coreai-models` at this repo's
root and apply the four-patch stack (the package depends on it by path; hybrid-architecture
bundles need the patches at runtime too):

```bash
cd ..   # repo root
git clone https://github.com/apple/coreai-models
git -C coreai-models apply apps/coreai-shared-product.patch \
                           apps/coreai-pipelined-extra-states.patch \
                           apps/coreai-pipelined-per-token-inputs.patch \
                           apps/coreai-pipelined-static-inputs.patch
cd swift
export DEVELOPER_DIR=/path/to/Xcode-beta.app/Contents/Developer
swift build -c release --product zoo-fm-gate
```

A path dependency was chosen over a URL dependency deliberately: SPM-managed checkouts are
immutable, so the patch stack — which the flagship hybrid bundles (Qwen3.5, LFM2.5, Granite)
require — could not be applied to one. Without the clone at the repo root, `swift build` fails
at manifest resolution; that is the documented trade-off.

Verification harness (macOS):

```bash
swift run -c release zoo-fm-gate <bundle-dir> chat        # plain-chat regress, streamed deltas
swift run -c release zoo-fm-gate <bundle-dir> tools       # two-tool round trip
swift run -c release zoo-fm-gate <bundle-dir> multiturn   # per-turn latency + KV reuse
ZOO_FM_DEBUG=1 ...                                        # log KV fast-path / reset decisions
```

Known limits (see [`../knowledge/fm-provider.md`](../knowledge/fm-provider.md) for the full
gap table): no `.guidedGeneration` on pipelined bundles (on-GPU sampling exposes no logits —
schema requests throw `unsupportedCapability`); one session per model instance at a time; the
tool-prompt dialect is Qwen/Hermes ChatML (LFM2.5's native special-token dialect is documented
but not yet rendered).

## CoreAIRunner (draft)

- `Sources/CoreAIRunner/HybridCoreAIEngine.swift` — generic **N-state** engine (Apple's
  `CoreAISequentialEngine` is hard-coded to 2 states; Qwen3.5/Gemma 4 need 4), fixed-capacity,
  greedy generate. Drives the all-in-one stateful `.aimodel` (`input_ids,position_ids → logits` +
  N in-place states).
- `Sources/CoreAIRunner/NDArrayHelpers.swift` — self-contained NDArray fill/read (no dependency
  on Apple's CoreAILanguageModels module).
- `Sources/coreai-run/` — a minimal CLI to validate the engine on macOS (feeds raw token ids,
  greedy-decodes, prints) before the iOS app.

⚠️ Authored against the exact API used by Apple's `CoreAISequentialEngine.swift`, not yet
compiled. Note: Apple's `CoreAILanguageModels` module also declares a type named `CoreAIRunner`
— don't import both modules in one file, or qualify uses.

See [`../knowledge/swift-runtime.md`](../knowledge/swift-runtime.md) for the API + per-model
runtime contracts, and [`../apps/CoreAIChat/`](../apps/CoreAIChat/) for the iOS chat app that
embeds the same patterns.
