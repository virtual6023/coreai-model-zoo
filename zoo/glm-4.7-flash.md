# GLM-4.7-Flash (text decoder) — Core AI

The **first model on the zoo with Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA)** — the
DeepSeek-V3 attention family Core AI had no port of — and a strong **local-coding**
model for 64/128 GB Macs. Source: `zai-org/GLM-4.7-Flash` (MIT, `model_type
glm4_moe_lite`).

Architecturally this is **MLA attention on all 47 layers + a sparse
Mixture-of-Experts FFN** (DeepSeek-V3 style):

- **MLA** (heads 20, `q_lora_rank` 768, `kv_lora_rank` 512, `qk_nope` 192 +
  decoupled `qk_rope` 64 = head_dim 256, `v_head_dim` 256, RoPE θ=1e6,
  **interleaved**). Authored in the **naive / materialized** form: the latent
  caches are projected up to per-head q/k/v, decoupled RoPE is applied to the
  64-dim rope slice, and the full per-head `[20, 256]` Q/K/V run through Apple's
  standard `SDPA` composite (scale `256**-0.5`). The KV cache stores the
  materialized per-head K/V (full-MHA size). *The absorbed-MLA form that keeps
  only the `[512]` latent in cache is a follow-up.*
- **MoE FFN** (layers 1–46; layer 0 is a dense `MLP(10240)`,
  `first_k_dense_replace=1`): 64 routed experts, top-4, plus **one non-gated
  shared expert**. Routing is `noaux_tc` which — at `n_group == topk_group == 1`
  — reduces exactly to **sigmoid scoring + selection-only bias correction**: the
  top-4 indices come from `sigmoid(logits) + e_score_correction_bias`, the
  gathered weights come from the **raw sigmoid**, then `norm_topk_prob` (÷sum)
  × `routed_scaling_factor` (1.8). Experts ride Apple's `SwitchGLU` / `GatherMM`
  composite (the data-dependent expert gather), the shared `MLP(1536)` is added
  directly (no sigmoid gate, unlike Qwen3.5-MoE).

**~30B parameters, ~3B active per token** → a strong local-coder that decodes at
**Mac-class speed** because only 4 of 64 experts fire per token.

| config | bundle | prefill tok/s | decode tok/s | numerics |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| **`sym8` gather kernel (reads 4/64 experts) = SHIP** | **30 GB** | **53.6** | **52.4** | **CLEAN — 0 introduced flips/18 vs fp16** (sym8 = the int8lin recipe via a bit-exact gather) |
| int8 linear (GatherMM, reads all 64 experts) | 30 GB | 20.5 | 20.3 | engine ≡ eager-int8 (exact 32-token greedy); fp16 ≡ fp32 oracle 16/16 — same int8 quality, dense over-read |
| int8hu @ -p 64 -g 128 (lower context) | 30 GB | 20.5 | 20.5 | — (decode is context-stable; set by per-token weight read, not KV growth) |
| int8hu, 2-layer control | 1.6 GB | 420 | 502 | — (engine-path smoke / scratch-heap pre-check) |

**52 tok/s for a 30B-class local coder on a Mac** (was 20.3 before the `gather_qmm`
kernel — **2.6×**). The [`gather_qmm`](../knowledge/compute-units-and-authoring.md)
Metal kernel reads only the 4 routed experts (4/64) instead of `GatherMM`'s dense
all-64 read, at the **same clean int8 quality** (`sym8` = the shipped int8lin recipe
via a bit-exact gather: 0 introduced flips/18 vs fp16). The rate is flat across
context (the per-token weight read dominates, not the KV cache). GLM is still a bit
slower than [Qwen3.6-35B-A3B](qwen3.6.md) (64.9 tok/s, also gather'd) for an
architectural reason: GLM runs **full MLA attention with a materialized full-MHA KV
cache on all 47 layers** (per-token: q_a→q_b `768→5120`, kv_a→kv_b `512→8960`
up-projections + a 20-head × 256-dim SDPA), whereas Qwen3.6 is a 3:1 hybrid that runs
cheap GatedDeltaNet linear-attention on ¾ of its layers. The **absorbed-MLA** form
(cache only the `[512]` latent, fold the up-projection into Q) is the remaining
decode/​KV-memory lever — the planned follow-up now that the expert-gather is solved.

## Numerics

The 30B model is ~120 GB in fp32 — too large for an fp32-resident oracle on a
128 GB host — so the parity ladder gates the **fp16 port vs the fp32 HF oracle**
(fp16-vs-fp32 rounding lowers cosines by ~1e-3, but a real logic bug collapses
them to <0.9, so structural errors are still caught). Results on a 16-token probe:

- **RoPE** cos/sin **1.000000** (the interleaved decoupled-RoPE convention,
  verified bit-exact vs HF — the non-interleaved path differs by attention-score
  ~25, so the convention is load-bearing).
- **Isolated MLA block** cosine **1.000000** (maxdiff 1.2e-4) — the naive
  materialized MLA is correct.
- **Isolated MoE block** cosine **1.000000** (maxdiff 1.0e-4) — `noaux_tc`
  routing + non-gated shared expert + `SwitchGLU` experts + the per-expert→
  SwitchLinear loader are correct.
- **Full prefill**: all 47 layers ≥0.9995, logits cosine 0.999977, **top-1
  16/16**; stateful decode (HF-seeded and self-seeded) cosine 1.000000 with
  matching argmax; teacher-forced S=1 sweep 16/16.

**int8 end-to-end** (raw `AIModel.load` aborts on the MoE→ANE `GatherMM` path —
see the [Qwen3.6 card](qwen3.6.md) — so the int8 gate drives the REAL engine):
the **coreai-sequential** engine (GPU, greedy) reproduces the **eager-int8 CPU
greedy continuation token-for-token** over 32 tokens from the probe prompt —
`". This process,—known as word embedding—is crucial for tasks like sentiment
analysis, machine translation, and question answering. However"` — a coherent,
on-topic continuation. So **engine ≡ python** at int8, and the int8 quantization
(linear per-block-32 body + absmax int8 head + 4-D SwitchLinear experts) holds
quality.

## Notes

- The MoE rides Apple's `SwitchGLU`/`GatherMM` exactly like Apple's own
  `gpt_oss`/`qwen3_moe`, so the **expert int8 quantization uses the documented
  4-D SwitchLinear override** (`block_size [1,1,1,32]`, `axis: None`); the
  **router stays fp16** (quantizing it can flip discrete expert selection for
  ~0.1 % of the bytes). The untied 154 880-vocab head uses the **absmax
  `symmetric` per-block-32** rule (clipping corrupts big-vocab heads).
- Prefill ≈ decode because prefill runs as pipelined S=1 steps
  (`COREAI_CHUNK_THRESHOLD=1`).
- **Mac-only**: at 30 GB int8 + a full-MHA materialized KV cache (~8 GB at 8 K
  ctx) the footprint is far past the iPhone jetsam limit. This is the 64/128 GB-Mac
  local-coder slot.
- The MoE expert-gather speed caveat is the same as the
  [Qwen3.6-35B-A3B card](qwen3.6.md): Apple's `GatherMM` over-reads the dense
  expert tensor, so int8 decode sits well below the per-token-active-bytes ideal;
  the deferred fix is a custom Metal `gather_qmm` kernel. int4 is not the free 2×
  it looks (non-QAT int4 flips structural tokens on these LLM mixers); int8 is the
  ship floor.

## How to reproduce

```bash
cd coreai-models   # with the glm4_moe_lite model overlay (see ../conversion)
# convert (CPU-side; ~60 GB fp16 load, mmap quantize keeps RAM in budget; ~30 GB bundle)
.venv/bin/python ../coreai-models-community/conversion/export_glm47_decode_pipelined.py \
    int8hu --head-sym
# bench (pipelined engine + COREAI_CHUNK_THRESHOLD=1)
COREAI_CHUNK_THRESHOLD=1 .build/release/llm-benchmark \
    --model exports/glm_4_7_flash_decode_int8hu_block32_sym -p 64 -g 128 -n 3
```

Model overlay: `models/macos/glm4_moe_lite.py` (MLA naive-materialized attention +
`noaux_tc` MoE on `SwitchGLU` + the per-expert checkpoint loader). **Decode-only
loop-free** for the pipelined engine; drive token-by-token with the
`coreai-sequential` engine variant (the default / `coreai-pipelined` variants feed
a prefill chunk that the static-`[1,1]` graph can't take).
