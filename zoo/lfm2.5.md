# LFM2.5-1.2B (text decoder) — Core AI

Conv + full-attention hybrid decoder (LiquidAI): 16 layers = **10 short-conv mixers**
(depthwise causal conv, kernel 3, B/C/x gating, no activation) + **6 GQA attention layers**
(32 q / 8 kv heads, head_dim 64, per-head q/k RMSNorm, full-dim RoPE θ=1e6), hidden 2048,
MLP 8192 (SwiGLU, auto-adjusted from 12288), vocab 65 536, tied head.

**⬇️ Converted `.aimodel` bundle (ready to run):
[mlboydaisuke/LFM2.5-1.2B-CoreAI](https://huggingface.co/mlboydaisuke/LFM2.5-1.2B-CoreAI)** —
`gpu-pipelined/lfm2_5_1_2b_instruct_decode_int8lin/` (full LanguageBundle incl. tokenizer;
ships the upstream LFM Open License v1.0 LICENSE file).

**The first non-Qwen architecture on the [pipelined-engine fast path](../knowledge/pipelined-engine.md)**
— and the easiest ride so far: LFM2 has **no recurrent scan at all** (the conv mixer is a
3-tap causal conv), so the decode graph is loop-free *by construction*, and the only extra
state is one fixed-shape conv buffer `[10, 1, 2048, 2]` — well inside the
extra-states patch budget (≤2). No engine changes needed beyond the existing patch stack.

## Measured (macOS + iOS 27 beta, release builds, p=128 g=256, `COREAI_CHUNK_THRESHOLD=1`)

| config | bundle | prefill tok/s | decode tok/s | numerics |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| fp16 (+fp32 attn proj), M4 Max | 2.2 GB | 162.8 | **162.1** | 16/16 oracle gate, cos ≥ 0.999998 |
| **int8 linear per-block-32 (ship), M4 Max** | **1.5 GB** | **253.3** | **253.3** | **16/16 oracle gate + HF-seeded decode step (cos ≥ 0.99992); engine path ≡ python-GPU 24/24 greedy** |
| **int8lin, iPhone 17 Pro** (PipelinedBench, n=2×2) | 1.5 GB | 39.2–39.4 | **38.0–39.6** | **nat 24/24 + oracle 24/24 on BOTH runs — token-identical to the M4 Max GPU sequences** |
| int8lin, iPhone 17 Pro, chat app (CoreAIChat LFM mode, 200-tok story) | 1.5 GB | 30.7 | **35.8** | coherent instruct output via the bundle chat template |

- **253 tok/s on a 1.2B** beats our qwen3.5-0.8B pipelined result (204) on a model 1.5× larger.
- Prefill ≈ decode because prefill runs as pipelined S=1 steps (`COREAI_CHUNK_THRESHOLD=1`).
- `llm-runner` (the real engine surface, on-GPU argmax sampling): 262 tok/s in a short run,
  warm load 2.7 s, output token-for-token identical to the python-runtime rollout (24/24).
- **iPhone: ~39 tok/s ≈ ~87% of the naive BW ceiling** (~60 GB/s ÷ ~1.4 GB/token ≈ 45) —
  a much higher fraction than qwen-0.8B realized (~60%); at ~1.4 GB/token the device is
  effectively memory-bandwidth saturated. Cold GPU specialization 6.8 s, warm load 1.6 s
  (no AOT needed). Cross-device determinism held again: iPhone greedy sequences were
  24/24 token-identical to Mac-GPU on both fixed prompts.
- **Chat app integrated**: CoreAIChat ([`../apps/CoreAIChat`](../apps/CoreAIChat)) has an
  LFM picker segment next to Gemma GPU/ANE and Qwen — both pipelined modes share one
  `PipelinedBackend` (spec-parameterized: bundle dir, HF subpath, warmup token); mode
  switches free the previous model set first. Headless hook: `GEMMA_ENGINE=lfm2`.

## Two GPU-delegate findings this port surfaced (both worked around in the model file)

Both are macOS-27-beta MPSGraph GPU-delegate behaviors, found by bisection with single-layer
probes; the workarounds live in the re-authored `models/macos/lfm2.py`:

1. **Chained fixed-shape state writes are silently dropped.** Per-layer
   `SSMState.update_states` calls compile to a read_handle → slice_update → write_handle
   round trip per conv layer on the *same* state handle. With more than one round trip the
   GPU delegate drops them ALL — the state buffer simply stays zero (the compiled IR is
   correct and token-chained; a single-slot graph works; a 3-slot repro fails). Decode then
   silently runs with no conv history: position 0 is right, everything after is garbage.
   **Workaround: layers return their new conv columns and the model issues ONE fused
   full-state `slice_update` per step.** (qwen3.5's 18-slot graph happens not to trigger
   this — pattern-dependent.)
2. **fp16 attention projections compute ~1.3% relative error under a dynamic-shape graph**
   (the fused attention-prologue matmul accumulates in fp16; the *same* matmul in a static
   graph measures 0.07%). LFM2.5's large q/k-norm gains (|k| up to ~14) amplify this and it
   compounds across the 16-layer stack into garbage logits (full-stack cos 0.71 vs eager).
   **Workaround: the four attention projections (q/k/v/out) keep fp32 weights** (cast in/out
   around the matmul) → layer-level cos 1.000000, +~126 MB. Conv-mixer and MLP matmuls
   measure clean in fp16 and stay fp16/int8.

## int8lin recipe (this model)

Per-block-32 **linear** int8 (scale-multiply dequant, no LUT — 256-entry LUT gathers are
slow on this delegate, see the qwen3.5 card). Quantized: MLP w1/w3/w2 + conv-mixer
in/out_proj (the bulk of the 1.17B params). Excluded: embedding (tied, fp16), depthwise
conv1d, norms, lm_head, **and the four attention projections** (the precision-critical
path above — quantizing them flips near-tie argmaxes: 14/16).

## Numerics gating

- Tier A parity ladder (fp32 eager vs HF oracle): conv block / attn block / full prefill /
  stateful decode + teacher-forced S=1 sweep — all cosine 1.000, 16/16 top-1.
- GPU gate (the [pipelined-engine](../knowledge/pipelined-engine.md) shipping gate):
  teacher-forced S=1 sweep over the 16 oracle positions on a fresh state + an
  HF-cache-seeded decode step, top-1 vs the fp32-HF oracle. **16/16 + decode for both
  bundles.**
- Oracle-validity note: the oracle prompt must not contain near-tie positions. Our first
  prompt had two positions with top-2 logit margins of 0.012–0.014 (statistical ties that
  even healthy int8 noise flips, and that fp16 passes only by luck). Gate prompts on a
  **fp32-oracle top-2 margin ≥ 0.1 at every position** (ours: ≥ 0.40) — computable before
  any bundle exists, so it selects the measuring instrument, not the result.

## Convert it yourself

```bash
cd coreai-models   # with the lfm2 model overlay (models/macos/lfm2.py) in place
.venv/bin/python ../coreai-models-community/conversion/export_lfm2_decode_pipelined.py int8lin
COREAI_CHUNK_THRESHOLD=1 ./.build/release/llm-benchmark \
    --model exports/lfm2_5_1_2b_instruct_decode_int8lin -p 128 -g 256 -n 3
```

Run contract (same as qwen3.5): Swift package patches
[`../apps/coreai-shared-product.patch`](../apps/coreai-shared-product.patch) +
[`../apps/coreai-pipelined-extra-states.patch`](../apps/coreai-pipelined-extra-states.patch)
applied on a fresh `coreai-models` clone; `COREAI_CHUNK_THRESHOLD=1` before engine creation;
never call `engine.warmup()` on the S=1 bundle (warm with a 1-token generate;
`llm-runner` needs `--warmup exact --warmup-length 1`).
